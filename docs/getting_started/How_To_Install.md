## How to install:

1. SCP the RPM to any client or server node.
2. Install RPM on host: `yum install <rpm_path>`
3. `cd /usr/local/nn-analytics/` on host and verify installation.
4. Make sure `db/` and `dfs/name/` have plenty of hard drive space. You can create shortcuts instead to other mounts if needed.
